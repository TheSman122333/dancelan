🧪 How It Works
Pose Estimation: The camera captures your movement frame-by-frame using MediaPipe.

Pose Matching: Each frame is compared to a "reference" dance move dataset, stored in [songname].json.

Scoring: The system gives you points based on how closely your pose matches the ideal one and how well-timed your movements are with the beat.

Feedback: After the dance, you get a detailed report of your performance.

🎮 Dance Modes
Single Player: Dance solo and improve your scores.
